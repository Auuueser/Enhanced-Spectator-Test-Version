# Usage

Enhanced Spectator currently implements client-local spectator freecam, modded-peer spectator presence, runtime floating-head/name visuals, and configurable routed spectator voice. Vanilla still owns death state, target switching, connection approval, and round lifecycle.

## Controls

Default controls:

| Action | Default |
| --- | --- |
| Toggle enhanced freecam | `F6` |
| Recenter near current target | `R` |
| Return to vanilla spectator view | `F7` |
| Move | `W` / `A` / `S` / `D` |
| Move up / down | `Space` / `LeftControl` |
| Look | Mouse |
| Fast movement | Hold `LeftShift` |
| Slow movement | Hold `LeftAlt` |

Forward and backward movement follows the camera look direction, so looking down while moving forward descends and looking up while moving forward ascends. The toggle, recenter, reset, fast, slow, ascend, and descend keys are configurable. WASD horizontal movement keys are fixed for the MVP.

While enhanced freecam is active, holding the configured ascend or descend key suppresses vanilla spectator target switching for that input frame. This keeps the default `Space` ascend key from being stolen by vanilla spectator controls.

| `NameTag.DebugNameTagLifecycle` | `false` | Reserved for verbose name tag diagnostics. |

When the in-game ESC quick menu is open, Enhanced Spectator pauses freecam movement/look input and suppresses local gameplay interaction/activate input so menu clicks do not also move spectator view or interact with the world. Vanilla spectator target selection is not suppressed while the menu is open because the right-side player list uses vanilla target switching.

## Behavior

- Vanilla still decides when the local player is dead.
- Vanilla still chooses and switches the spectated target.
- Vanilla spectator UI remains authoritative.
- Enhanced Spectator only writes `StartOfRound.spectateCamera.transform` while freecam is active and safe.
- If the local player revives, target state is lost, or vanilla game-over override activates, freecam stops writing the camera.
- If the controller throws an exception, it logs the failure and disables enhanced freecam so vanilla spectator camera can continue.
- When `Logging.EnableDebugLogging=true`, startup logs include the loaded plugin DLL path and SHA256 hash for host/client build verification.
- During disconnect, host shutdown, application quit, or scene transition teardown, Enhanced Spectator stops mod-owned network sends and unregisters handlers when safe.
- When target sync is available, debug presence logs can report when a remote modded player starts or stops spectating, and separately whether that spectator is watching the local player.
- When remote pose sync is available, placeholder markers can represent any remote modded spectator, not only spectators watching the local player. The marker follows the last remote spectator freecam world position and smooths toward newer poses. `FloatingHead.ShowOnlySpectatorsWatchingMe=true` restores the older watched-player-only filtering. Strict world-space placement remains the default; diagnostic view-edge and screen fallback modes are still opt-in.
- When `FloatingHead.UseRuntimeDetachedHeadVisuals=true`, the visual service tries to read the already loaded ghost-girl ragdoll template from `StartOfRound.playerRagdolls[1]` and copy its `DeadBodyInfo.detachedHeadObject` renderer data into a clean mod-owned object. It does not export assets, instantiate the full ragdoll prefab, or require the represented spectator to have been killed by the ghost girl. If the template source is missing and fallback is enabled, the existing placeholder marker is used.
- When a modded peer identity is known but vanilla first-join/rejoin ownership timing left that peer out of the local ESC player list, or left stale dead/disconnected/model-hidden flags locally, the connected-player repair pass uses vanilla `ClientPlayerList` plus mod spectator target state to restore the peer's controlled/dead/disconnected/live-model state and display name locally. This is a targeted compatibility repair for modded peers only.
- Phase 3F adds runtime-only placeholder styles and optional visual pulse. Voice activity sync now sends visual-only local amplitude metadata between modded peers, so a dead spectator's head can scale from the spectator's own microphone amplitude even when the watched player's client sees remote playback amplitude as `0`. Positive synced amplitude drives scale directly; `VoicePlayerState.IsSpeaking` still drives a fallback pulse when amplitude is unavailable or zero. It does not forward voice or change Dissonance routing.
- Phase 4F adds configurable dead spectator voice routing. By default, `VoiceRouting.SpectatorVoiceAudienceMode=AllModdedPlayers`, so compatible modded players can hear dead spectators regardless of whether the listener is alive or dead. More restrictive modes can limit this to the watched target, alive players only, or dead players only. When pose sync is available, routed voice is positioned at the remote spectator's synced freecam pose and can be attenuated by listener distance. It does not open new Dissonance channels, create audio objects, patch voice methods, or bypass local deafen/local mute. It restores local playback volume for an eligible dead remote spectator already represented by vanilla/Dissonance playback state and only when both peers advertise the voice-routing capability. If vanilla fails to attach that playback state to the right `PlayerControllerB`, the mod uses synced peer identity's Dissonance player id as a fallback binding key for the existing playback object.
- For normal multiplayer testing after voice routing has been validated, keep `VoiceRouting.EnableSpectatorVoiceToTarget=true`, `VoiceRouting.SpectatorVoiceAudienceMode=AllModdedPlayers`, `VoiceRouting.SpectatorVoiceUseRemotePosePosition=true`, `VoiceRouting.SpectatorVoiceEnableDistanceAttenuation=true`, and `VoiceRouting.SpectatorVoiceFallbackTo2DWhenPoseMissing=false`, but keep `Logging.EnableDebugLogging=false`, `Networking.DebugNetworkMessages=false`, `Networking.DebugVoiceActivitySync=false`, `FloatingHead.DebugVisualLifecycle=false`, and `VoiceRouting.DebugSpectatorVoiceRouting=false` unless you are diagnosing a specific route issue.
- Positional spectator voice maps the synced remote spectator pose into Unity's actual active `AudioListener` frame. This preserves the direction and distance heard from the rendered spectate/freecam camera even when the game keeps a different internal audio listener enabled during dead spectator mode.
- Phase 4B adds runtime-only name tags above placeholder markers. Tags prefer synced mod peer identity, then confirmed in-game `playerUsername`, and finally client/slot ids if unavailable.
- When model inspection is enabled before launch, pressing the configured inspection key logs one player model hierarchy snapshot for runtime research.
- When head source inspection is enabled before launch, pressing the configured inspection key logs one dead-body detached-head source snapshot for each current player corpse. It reads `PlayerControllerB.deadBody`, `DeadBodyInfo.detachedHead`, and `DeadBodyInfo.detachedHeadObject` metadata only; it does not clone, export, instantiate, or mutate model objects.
- When voice diagnostics are enabled before launch, pressing the configured inspection key logs an Info-level key-pressed line plus one local read-only snapshot of Dissonance and vanilla player voice state. The snapshot includes `timestampTicks` for host/client log correlation and reports when no player voice rows were captured. It records local observation only, does not require mod custom messaging to be available, and does not prove that routing is safe by itself.

## Known Limits

- Networking is a Phase 3B transport spike: capability, spectator target, and spectator pose messages are sent only between modded peers that complete handshake.
- Capability sends are delayed briefly after transport registration to avoid sending during unstable Netcode connection setup.
- Direct client-to-client sends are not implemented. With `Networking.EnableHostRelay=true`, the host can relay compatible client spectator target and pose state to other modded clients.
- Floating-head visuals are local-only runtime objects, not network objects and not formal UI. By default they are placeholder markers. The optional detached-head visual mode clones a confirmed runtime corpse head object only when it exists and never exports or saves assets.
- Name tags do not patch HUD and do not read unconfirmed player-name fields. The only game name source used is confirmed `PlayerControllerB.playerUsername`; fallback ids remain available.
- Voice activity feedback prefers synced local speaker amplitude from modded peers. If voice activity sync is disabled or unavailable, it falls back to locally readable Dissonance playback state for the represented spectator. If neither source provides data, the marker remains at the silent style.
- Floating-head visuals require compatible modded peers, capability handshake, spectator target sync, and a matching active spectator pose. This prevents stale target-only state from creating local fallback visuals during disconnect, rejoin, or target-switch windows. Cross-client visibility requires a modded host with `Networking.EnableHostRelay=true`; it does not work with an unmodded host.
- Model inspection is log-only. It does not clone heads, create visuals, export assets, or save raw inspection output into the repository.
- Head source inspection is log-only. It is meant for ghost-girl decapitation research and does not create a real head visual.
- Voice diagnostics are log-only. They do not forward voice, open Dissonance channels, change `VoicePlayerState.Volume`, create audio objects, or patch voice methods.
- Voice routing is configurable and defaults on only for compatible Enhanced Spectator peers. Positional playback and distance attenuation depend on spectator pose sync; when pose data is missing, the route drops by default instead of falling back to stale 2D/global playback. It does not rewrite Dissonance routing or create independent positional audio channels.
- Freecam writes the spectator camera during Unity camera pre-cull. Another mod writing the same camera from a later camera callback can still win.
- WASD horizontal movement keys are fixed in this MVP; vertical and action keys are configurable.
