# Changelog

## 0.1.3

### Spectator Visibility

- Kept remote floating-head visuals visible when a dead spectator toggles from enhanced freecam to vanilla spectator view.
- Restored enhanced freecam pose sync cleanly after toggling back from vanilla spectator view.
- Continued publishing vanilla spectator camera pose while enhanced freecam is disabled and the player is still spectating.

### Stability

- Added regression coverage for the enhanced-freecam to vanilla-spectator to enhanced-freecam cycle.
